# MXBoard

MXBoard is the training/testing visualization user interface for [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). And
it is designed to support `image classification` and `object detection` training/test task now. After I finish the basic
parts, I will consider to make it possible to support other deep learning task.

## 1. How to Use

## 2. Architecture

## 3. Open APIs

In my original design, the mxboard will have open APIs in the form of `flask webservice`. I design roughly 3 interfaces.

### 3.1 train

### 3.2 test

### 3.3 stop

## 4. Thirdparty Dependency

### 4.1 Java Thirdparty Dependency

### 4.2 Python Thirdparty Dependency
